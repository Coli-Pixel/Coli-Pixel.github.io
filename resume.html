In the 2019 Y Be Fit event at the YMCA and Civic Center Park, I directed people towards the main entrance and managed the people entering and exiting. In the summer of 2017, I volunteered at the local Martha's Village and cleaned and organized several dishes and other kitchenware for two days. I also helpled clean the floors and tables before the lunch was distributed. I have also volunteered at some other local running events doing prep work.</h4></p>
        <p><h4>Skills: Some skills that I have pertaining to my job will be learned in future instruction, but I have been to a coding camp at U.C. Irvine where I learned some C++ and Python, which I forgot, but I can relearn it quickly.</h4></p>
