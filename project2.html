        <h4>There were two main complications that we went through. We had a problem with trying to actually make the code subtract in the base code and later in the subtract function. I fixed the problem in the main code by fixing indentation errors and in the subtraction function I fixed by using the global keyword. Another thing was actually creating a function that called another function but we were able to do it by placing the base code into the subtract function. The thing I did by myself was creating the base code before it was integrated into the subtraction function. It did everything but it didn't have a function that called another function. My partner created the subtract function that used the base code.</h4>
