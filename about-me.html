        <p>Have you ever wondered how safe you really were on the internet? Well, my career goal for the future is to work for a company that provides cyber security. In order to achieve this goal, I have enrolled into Computer Science Principles in my junior year of high school. If I do well in this class I'll continue my education in computer science in my senior in AP Compuer Science and further my education into college. I chose cyber security as a career choice because it personally bothers me that someone would extract personal information on others online especially when it's so popular. I would like to contribute to a safer experience for the people who use the internet regularly without the threat of malware and hackers with malicious intent.</p>
        <p>Some of my positive characteristics are: realistic, reliable, and supportive. An activity that shows how supportive I am is soccer because even though I am not good at shooting or handling the ball, I do well in keeping ball away from the middle and passing to my teammates. I am also reliable because I am usually prepared for what I do and I bring a little extra just in case anyone needs to borrow something like paper or a pen or if someone doesn't know how to do something I can help explain to it them if I understand it. The last trait I would like to talk about is that I'm realistic. I'm not the type of person to propose some kind of absurd project or take on something that is far above my capabilities. If I needed something from someone I would analyze who would be best for the job or if the job given to that person is fit for them.</p>
        <p>I have an experience during my time in high school that has taught me important lessons that I would like to share. In my sophomore year, I took a college chemistry dual enrollment class. In that class, I had several peers who were much more intelligent than me. At the time I had hard time bringing myself to study, until in my 2nd semester, I failed my first test. I had only realized then that those people had been able to pass the test because they stayed up late at night studying and that I needed to change my study habits. This was an important lesson because I had been a bit of a slacker in my studies, so I forced myself to study until I completely understood the topic and answer the practice questions with ease. By the end of the year, I had over 100% in the. The lesson I learned was: only through hard work could I prosper.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, I want to pursue a career in cyber security and I hope that my traits and experiences can help me continue my path towards this career. To whoever is reading this, thank you for taking the time to read this page about me to the end and why not check out the rest of my site.</p>
